## Installation


This project uses Python v3.10.4 and the [venv module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). 


Before installing the dependencies for the first time, you will need to create a virtual environment. As the project depends on Python v3.10.4, make sure that this is the current python version used in the moment that the virtual environment is created.

## Setting up Python v3.10.4 using `pyenv`

If your current python installation is not 3.10.4, you may use a solution such as [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). After following [pyenv's installation walkthrough](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), you can install the desired Python version by doing:

```
$ pyenv install 3.12.6
``` 

Afterwards, switch the python version used in the current shell by doing:

```
$ pyenv shell 3.12.6
```

For problems with `pyenv` installation or usage, please refer to [its official documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file).

## Creating a Virtual Environment and Installing Dependencies
pye
We use a virtual environment in order to maintain, organize and share the dependencies of our system.

_Before creating a virtual environment, make sure that the Python version you're currently using is v.3.12.6. Run `python -V` and make sure the output is equivalent to `Python 3.12.6`_.

Create a virtual environment for the project doing:
```
$ python -m venv ./.venv
```

Before running the code for the first time, remember to install the required python dependencies using our newly created virtual environment. Firstly, activate the virtual environment using:
```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` by using `pip`

```
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Executing

After creating a virtual environment with the required dependencies, one must always activate the virtual environment before executing the system's scripts. If you haven't activated the virtual environment in the current shell, do so:
```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
_Note that this might not be necessary if you've just finished installing the system's dependencies using the current shell._
